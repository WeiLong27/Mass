# MASS - Tokenization POC Project

This project is a POC of a tokenization platform and marketplace that aims to onboard the mass majority of the world into the world of web3, one step at a time. The project aims to be the link between real world and web3, providing an easy and smooth onboarding process and offer a streamlined, simple pipeline to access products and offerings of great benefits whilst abstracting away unnecessary and complex concepts that is often the prerequisite for people to just gain access to the new world of web3, much less take advantage of the benefits and opportunities offered.
